# Python Project Kickoff - Datavalet Sample for Workshop

Welcome to our Python Project Kickoff! This document outlines the first steps to get you started.

## Step 1: Environment Setup

Before diving into coding, ensure that your Python environment is set up correctly. This includes installing Python, setting up a virtual environment, and installing necessary packages.

- Install Python from the official website.
- Create a virtual environment using `python -m venv venv`.
- Activate the virtual environment.
- Install necessary packages using `pip install`.

## Step 2: Initial Code Structure

Start by setting up the basic structure of your Python project. This step involves creating the main Python file and any necessary modules.

- Create a new Python file named `main.py`.
- Define the basic classes and functions.
- Write a simple script to test the setup.

## Step 3: Version Control

Version control is essential for any software project. Set up a Git repository for your project.

- Initialize a Git repository using `git init`.
- Add your files to the repository with `git add .`.
- Commit your changes using `git commit -m "Initial commit"`.

Follow these steps to get a solid start on your Python project!
